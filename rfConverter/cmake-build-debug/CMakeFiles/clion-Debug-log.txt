CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPythonLibs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "PythonLibs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PythonLibs" with
  any of the following names:

    PythonLibsConfig.cmake
    pythonlibs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PythonLibs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "PythonLibs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "PythonLibs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
